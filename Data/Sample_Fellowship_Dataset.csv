then he pops up again.’

[Mr. Butterbur]: ‘He was in and out pretty often last spring;
but I haven’t seen him about lately. What his right name is
I’ve never heard: but he’s known round here as Strider.
Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; though he don’t tell
nobody what cause he has to hurry.’

for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers
and the Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should
ask about him.’",Neutral
13,43,"[Sam]: ‘Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so cold through 
the long nights. But glory and trumpets!’
he cried, turning round again with shining eyes and
dancing on the floor.

[Sam]: ‘It’s fine to see you up and yourself again, sir!
Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were
ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.’
[Frodo]: ‘I am ready,’ said Frodo.

11,35,"After the Road had run down some way, and had left
Bree-hill standing tall and brown behind, they came on a
narrow track that led off towards the North.

[Aragorn]: ‘This is where we leave the open and take to cover,’ 
said Strider.

[Pippin]: ‘Not a ‘‘short cut’’, I hope,’ said Pippin.

[Pippin]: ‘Our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster.’

Strider.

[Aragorn]: ‘My cuts, short or long, don’t go wrong.’
He took a look up and down the Road.",Positive
8,41,"He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound.

Raising himself on one arm he looked, and saw now in the
pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind
them turned a corner.

Round the corner a long arm was
groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was lying
nearest, and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him.

At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into
stone by the incantation.

Then a wild thought of escape came to him.",Negative
12,61,"Nothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment
from the hobbits, and then even Frodo laughed.

[Frodo]: ‘Well!’ he said.
[Frodo]: ‘We are forgetting our family history! These must be
the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over
the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.’

[Pippin]: ‘I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!’
said Pippin. He knew the story well.",Positive
22,26,"[Boromir]: ‘I do not say destroy it. That might be well, if reason could show 
any hope of doing so. It does not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that 
a halfling should walk blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance 
of recapturing it for himself. Folly!’

[Boromir]: ‘Surely you see it, my friend?’ he said, turning now suddenly 
to Frodo again.
[Boromir]: ‘You say that you are afraid.’ 
[Boromir]: ‘If it is so, the boldest should pardon you. But is it not 
really your good sense that revolts?’

[Frodo]: ‘No, I am afraid,’ said Frodo.
[Frodo]: ‘Simply afraid.’ ",Negative
22,10,"[Aragorn]: ‘Most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice would 
still wait on you. Such is your fate.’

Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly.

[Frodo]: ‘I know that haste is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden is 
heavy. Give me an hour longer, and I will speak. Let me be alone!’

Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity.

[Aragorn]: ‘Very well, Frodo son of Drogo,’ he said.
[Aragorn]: ‘You shall have an hour, and you shall be alone.
We will stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.’",Negative
7,69,"Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
start, and checked an exclamation.

Frodo was delighted (in
a way): it was his own ring all right, for Merry was staring
blankly at his chair, and obviously could not see him.

He got
up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer
door.

[Tom Bombadil]: ‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most
seeing look in his shining eyes.

[Tom Bombadil]: ‘Hey! Come Frodo, there!
Where be you a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s not as blind as
that yet.",Positive

you, if I find that you are gone.’

you pass through Bree.
You can trust the landlord (Butterbur).
You may meet a friend of mine on the Road: a Man, lean, dark,
tall, by some called Strider.
He knows our business and will help you.’

There I hope we may meet again.’",Neutral
15,68,"[Gandalf]: ‘The land and the weather will be milder now, but perhaps 
all the more dangerous.’

[Frodo]: ‘Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,’ said
Frodo, throwing back his hood and letting the morning light
fall on his face.

[Pippin]: ‘But the mountains are ahead of us,’ said Pippin.
[Pippin]: ‘We must have turned eastwards in the night.’
[Gandalf]: ‘No,’ said Gandalf.

[Gandalf]: ‘But you see further ahead in the clear light.
Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west.’",Positive

and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale,

When every guest had been welcomed and was finally
inside the gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and,
of course, food and drink.

There were three official meals:
lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper).

But lunch and tea were
marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests
were sitting down and eating together.",Neutral
12,2,"Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had 
vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed 
past him, and he fell. He heard Frodo’s voice, but it seemed 
to come from a great distance, or from under the earth, 
crying out strange words.

They saw nothing more, until they stumbled over the body
of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the grass with
his sword beneath him.

Strider ordered them to pick him up
and lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared.",Negative

Horse-lords, dwell, and there are no horses like those that are
bred in that great vale between the Misty Mountains and the White.’

I said to Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith.
[Gwaihir]: ‘‘They pay a tribute of horses,’’ he answered, [Gwaihir]: ‘‘and send
many yearly to Mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke. 
But if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long 
delayed.’’ ’",Positive
17,46,"[Gandalf]: ‘What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a
challenge. The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me.’

[Gandalf]: ‘For an instant the door left my control and began to open!
I had to speak a word of Command. That proved too great a strain. The 
door burst in pieces. Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the 
light inside, and I was thrown backwards down  the stairs. All the wall 
gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I think.’

else is buried there too. I cannot say.’",Negative
2,104,"[Gandalf]: ‘That is a sample of his talk.I don’t suppose you want any
more.’

[Gandalf]: ‘I had weary days of it. But from hints dropped among
the snarls I gathered that his padding feet had taken him at
last to Esgaroth, and even to the streets of Dale, listening
secretly and peering.’

far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo’s
name and knew where he came from.’",Neutral

But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves’ tongues run on when 
speaking of their handiwork, they say.’

doings of the Dwarf-kingdom.",Neutral

Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long.’

[Merry]: ‘And it is possible that in the morning even a 
Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would 
be let through. It is pretty generally known that you are 
coming back to live at Crickhollow.’

Frodo sat for a while in thought.

[Frodo]: ‘I have made up my
mind,’ he said finally.

[Frodo]: ‘I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it
is light. But I am not going by road: it would be safer 
to wait here than that.’",Neutral
13,117,"Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in
his chair and the fire was on his face like summer-light upon
the trees. Near him sat the Lady Arwen.

To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; 
his dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to be clad 
in elven-mail, and a star shone on his breast.

They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed to Frodo 
that Arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell 
on him from afar and pierced his heart.

He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the
Elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody.",Positive
3,12,"Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even
more debatable than the price.

A few held the theory – supported by the nods and hints 
of Mr. Baggins himself – that Frodo’s money was running 
out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way 
on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among 
his Brandybuck relations.

[Public]: ‘As far
from the Sackville-Bagginses as may be,’ some added.",Neutral
21,88,"The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in gesture of
warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head
there was a crumbling helm and crown. Great power and majesty 
they still wore, the silent wardens of a long-vanished kingdom.

Awe and fear fell upon Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes 
and not daring to look up as the boat drew near.",Negative
1,73,"But at the same time he felt deeply troubled:
he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly.

Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing
Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-

Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want
to have any more to do with the party.",Negative
19,52,"[Sam]: ‘Well,’ said Sam, 
[Sam]: ‘you can’t see nobody working it. No fireworks like poor old 
Gandalf used to show. I wonder we don’t see nothing of the Lord 
and Lady in all these days.’

[Sam]: ‘I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things, if
she had a mind. I’d dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr.
Frodo!’
[Frodo]: ‘I wouldn’t,’ said Frodo.
[Frodo]: ‘I am content. And I don’t miss Gandalf’s fireworks, 
but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.’

[Sam]: ‘And don’t think I’m finding fault.’",Positive
9,44,"The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive,
and Frodo soon found that some explanation of what he was
doing would have to be given.

He gave out that he was
interested in history and geography (at which there was much
wagging of heads, although neither of these words were
much used in the Bree-dialect).",Neutral
16,4,"[Gandalf]: ‘to go back is to admit defeat, and face worse defeat to come.
If we go back now, then the Ring must remain there: we shall not be able 
to set out again.’

[Gandalf]: ‘Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged,
and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. The
Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows
yet of the power and terror they would possess if the Ruling
Ring was on their master’s hand again.’

sigh. Sam sank back into gloom.",Negative
14,102,"[Gandalf]: ‘And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other
test that I spoke of.’

[Gandalf]: ‘Upon this very ring which you have here
seen held aloft, round and unadorned, the letters that Isildur
reported may still be read, if one has the strength of will to
set the golden thing in the fire a while.’

[Gandalf]: ‘That I have done, and this I have read:
Ash nazg durbatuluk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg
thrakatuluk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.’

My mind is clearer now.’

[Boromir]: ‘Then you will come to Minas Tirith?’ cried Boromir.
His eyes were shining and his face eager.

[Frodo]: ‘You misunderstand me,’ said Frodo.

Mordor than from here.’",Positive

[Frodo]: ‘I hardly feel that I have moved at all.’

The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs 
on the floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw 
open a door at the far end. Firelight came out, and a puff 
of steam.

[Pippin]: ‘A bath!’ cried Pippin.

way, Master Peregrin.’",Positive

[Elves]: ‘Come! Now is the time for speech and merriment!’
Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered.

[Elf]: ‘There is a fire in the hall, and food for hungry guests,’ 
said an Elf standing before him. At the south end of the greensward 
there was an opening. There the green floor ran on into the wood, 
and formed a wide space like a hall, roofed by the boughs of trees.

Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side.",Negative
6,63,"The twigs crackled.

Little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind 
of the ancient tree and scorched it. A tremor ran through 
the whole willow. The leaves seemed to hiss above their 
heads with a sound of pain and anger.

A loud scream came from Merry, and from far
inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell.

[Merry]: ‘Put it out! Put it out!’ cried Merry.

the other side of the tree.",Negative

always said,’ the Gaffer declared.

With perfect truth: for Bilbo
was very polite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and

consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables –
in the matter of ‘roots’, especially potatoes, the Gaffer was
recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbour-
hood (including himself).

Noakes of Bywater.",Neutral

put in a bolster down the middle of each bed.
And I made a
nice imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr.

Tooks and Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (re-
lations of Bilbo Baggins’ grandmother), and various Chubbs
(connexions of his Took grandfather); and a selection of
Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies,
Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very
distantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardly ever
been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of
the Shire.",Neutral
8,31,"A change was coming in the weather. The mist was flowing 
past him now in shreds and tatters. His breath was smoking, 
and the darkness was less near and thick.

He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were 
appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog.
The wind began to hiss over the grass.

He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and
he made towards it; and even as he went forward the mist was
rolled up and thrust aside, and the starry sky was unveiled.",Positive

[Aragorn]: ‘There is no doubt that he was tormented,
and the fear of Sauron lies black on his heart. Still I for
one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful Elves of
Mirkwood. His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly
to be believed in one so lean and withered. He could work
much mischief still, if he were free.’

[Aragorn]: ‘And I do not doubt that
he was allowed to leave Mordor on some evil errand.’",Positive
7,71,"Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the
Ring he came and sat down again.

Tom now told them that
he reckoned the Sun would shine tomorrow, and it would be
a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful.

But they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was
a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would 
change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket.

But only a few trials, I think, will be needed; and I shall not have to call on Gimli 
for words of the secret dwarf-tongue that they teach to none. The opening 
words were Elvish, like the writing on the arch: that seems certain.’

He stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with
his staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the
anvil.

He had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the 
Shire; and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone 
who had beaten his master, however long ago.

After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural
prospects (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot
put down his mug and looked at them all in turn.

[Old Maggot]: ‘Now, Mr. Peregrin,’ he said,

Were you coming to visit me?
For, if so, you had gone past my gate without
my seeing you.’",Negative

come to an agreement without any words being spoken.

only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall, but 
the sounds were those of shrill cries, and wild howls of laughter.",Negative

Legolas!’ said Gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas.
[Gimli]: ‘That was a mighty shot in the dark, my friend!’
[Legolas]: ‘But who can say what it hit?’ said Legolas.
[Gimli]: ‘I cannot,’ said Gimli.

no nearer. I liked it not at all. Too much it reminded me of
the shadow in Moria – the shadow of the Balrog,’ he ended

The second disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was dis-
cussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year
and a day, and was remembered much longer than that.

It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; and eventually
Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash
and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, became a favourite
character of legend and lived on long after all the true events
were forgotten.",Neutral

down in a chair,

it were of transparency, about him, and especially about the

has done so twice,’ said Pippin;

slipped away as you drew near.’

corner and nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and
he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.

[Elves]: ‘No more, no more!’ cried the Elves laughing.
[Elves]: ‘You have eaten enough already for a long day’s march.’

make for journeys in the wild,’ said the Dwarf.

appointed by the Council. Your own way you alone can choose. In this 
matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, and though I have tried 
to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this 
hour, if indeed he had any.’

still wait on you. Such is your fate.’",Negative

We have other business.’

I’ll leave you to guess, if you want to.’
He got up and came towards Frodo.

I don’t often get asked for a second hearing. What did you think
of it?’",Neutral

I’ll just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming.
We’ll see about supper and things.’

should do, but I am afraid of doing it, Boromir: afraid.’

Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured 
in the branches of the trees. Frodo shivered. Suddenly Boromir came 
and sat beside him.

Will you not take mine?’",Negative

just what the Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of
the great people, the Men of the West. They have helped me
before; and I shall need their help in the days to come; for
we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at rest.’

[Frodo]: ‘I suppose not,’ said Frodo.

[Frodo]: ‘But so far my only thought has been to get here; and I 
hope I shan’t have to go any further. It is very pleasant just to rest.
I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has been 
as much as I want.’

again.",Positive

his arms,

If the danger were not so dark, I should dance for joy.
Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have 
felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.’

no other way, and we are already defeated?’

If we go back now, then the Ring must remain there: we shall not be able 
to set out again.’",Negative

seemed to know you were going away, so I didn’t see the use
of denying it. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!’

[Frodo]: ‘Do you like them still, now you
have had a closer view?’

there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders.

[Tom Bombadil]: ‘Show me the precious Ring!’

he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his own 
astonishment, drew out the chain from his pocket, and unfastening 
the Ring handed it at once to Tom.

It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big
brown-skinned hand.

Then suddenly he put it to his eye and

overcame the Shire; if all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers,
Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not to
mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.’

Frodo shuddered.
[Frodo]: ‘But why should we be?’ he asked.

[Frodo]: ‘And why should he want such slaves?’

We will stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.’

Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who
had been watching his master with great concern, shook his
head and muttered: ‘Plain as a pikestaff it is, but it’s no good
Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.’",Negative
12,52,"The spirits of the party rose again.

Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every now and

turned round and called to them.

the Gaffer.

his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no
tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter
of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I’d not long come

sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade.

backwards, if he had seen it.

White is the greatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a
worthy Wizard, a master of shapes and changes of hue; and
he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially

Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall
him.’

Dol Guldur.’",Positive

kept on interrupting. I tried to make a few notes, but we shall have 
to go over it all again together some time, if I am to write it up. 
There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!’

I still want to know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.’",Neutral

shaking all over and looked at the Lady.

But do not think that only by singing amid the trees, nor even by 
the slender arrows of elven-bows, is this land of Lothlorien 
maintained and defended against its Enemy.’

Gandalf, smiling.

you are the Ring-bearer. And you are the heir of Bilbo, the
Ring-finder.’

[Frodo]: ‘Dear Bilbo!’ said Frodo sleepily.

Homely House east of the Sea.",Positive

When he looked back he found
that he was alone: the others had not followed him.

There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past
the stones shouting wildly:

Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and
taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave

He reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the

eighth.

It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set
out and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his
mind, and the one thing that made the thought of leaving
bearable.

He thought as little as possible about the Ring, and

Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may
prove the worst. I let the matter be.’

and endured long speech with him.’

myself in a more ordinary fashion; but I got through 
the hedge and walked along the field inside. I was peeping 
through into the road, after the S.-B.s had passed, and was 
looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught 
a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser-pocket.’

often what Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness
wore off, and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a
while.

Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous

advanced. Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they 
threw themselves flat on the ground.

reluctance to reveal the Ring, and a loathing of its touch. He
wished he was far away.",Negative

There was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves,
